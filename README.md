# witness

Token & cost tracking for AI coding agents — one append-only usage log per repo,
written by a small extension for each agent harness.

- **Per-repo**: data lives in `<git-root>/.witness/usage.jsonl` (override with `WITNESS_DIR`). Keyed by git remote URL, so totals accumulate across sessions — restarts included.
- **Per-turn breakdown**: input/output/cache/reasoning tokens, cost, and per-tool usage + errors, per turn.
- **Harness-agnostic**: the storage layer (`packages/witness`) knows nothing about pi/Claude/Copilot/OpenCode; each `apps/*` package is a thin adapter that maps its harness's events onto the same `Session` API.
- **Append-only schema**: short keys, never renamed — new fields may be added, old lines always parse.

## Agents

### PI

#### Technical details

##### Where data is stored

Usage is written to `<git-root>/.witness/usage.jsonl` (override with `WITNESS_DIR`). Each line is one JSON record per agent run — one prompt and all of its turns. The repository is identified by its git remote URL; if there is no remote, the git root is used, and if there is no git repo, the current directory.

The file is append-only and uses a shared format, so adapters for other agents (Claude, Copilot, OpenCode; planned) write to the same file. Old lines keep parsing when the format changes, and malformed lines are skipped.

##### When data is written

Turns are kept in memory and written in a single append when the agent goes idle and when it shuts down. This keeps writes safe when several agent sessions run on the same repo at once. The trade-off: if the agent is killed hard (e.g. `kill -9`), the current unsaved run is lost.

##### Dashboard server

`/witness-pi:show` starts a small HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:4444`, reachable only from your own machine. It serves the bundled viewer and an `/api/records` endpoint that returns the records for the current repo. It stops when the session ends.

## Install (pi)

From git (once this repo has a public remote):

```bash
pi install git:github.com/OWNER/witness
```

Or without installing, for one run:

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/OWNER/witness
```

Teams can share it via project settings (`-l`): pi installs missing packages automatically once the project is trusted.

> Security: pi extensions run with full system access. Review the source before installing (it's short — `packages/witness/index.ts` + `apps/witness-pi/extensions/index.ts`).

## Other agents

`apps/witness-claude`, `apps/witness-copilot`, `apps/witness-opencode` are placeholders for adapters using the same core. To add one: new `apps/witness-<harness>` package, depend on `witness: workspace:*`, call `Session` on the harness's turn-end events, flush on idle/shutdown. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## CI

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs two jobs:

- **quality** — every push (except release tags): install, `bun audit`, format check, lint, tests.
- **release** — on tag `<app>-vX.Y.Z`: publishes `apps/<app>` to npm, after checking the tag matches the package's `version`.

Releasing an extension (per-package versions, independent of each other):

```bash
cd apps/witness-pi
npm version 1.2.4 --no-git-tag-version
cd ../..
git commit -am "witness-pi 1.2.4" && git tag witness-pi-v1.2.4
git push origin main --tags
```

A new `apps/witness-<harness>` adapter needs no pipeline changes — tagging `witness-claude-v0.1.0` publishes `apps/witness-claude`.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun test
bun run lint
```

Building the pi extension (bundles extension + local-web viewer into `dist/`):

```bash
cd apps/witness-pi
bun run build
```

Bun workspaces monorepo:

- `packages/witness` — core `Session` class (record schema, storage, repo totals)
- `packages/types` — shared `Usage` / `Tool` / `AgentTurnRecord` interfaces
- `apps/witness-pi` — pi extension (`extensions/index.ts` maps pi events to `Session`)
- `apps/local-web` — the dashboard UI
